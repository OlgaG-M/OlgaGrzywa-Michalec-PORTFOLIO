# PORTFOLIO
My Tester's Portfolio 🕵️‍♂️ 🐛

## About Me

My name is Olga Grzywa-Michalec. Recently I have deicided to change my career path and become a Software Tester.

WHY do I want to be a Software Tester?
* because I have worked hard to develop skills that are relevant to this industry
* moreover, this type of work gives never ending possibilities of development which brings me personal satisfaction
* furthermore a big adventage of being a QA in my opinion is that this profession seems to be both creative and structured
* also I think my previous professional corporate experience, sports career and soft skills fit perfectly for QA position:
  
I’m experienced, open-minded Senior Customer Service Specialist with flexible approach and can-do attitude. I am meticulous, persistent, patient, with a passion for quality. Both empathetic and assertive. Works well within a team and individually.

🎯My career goal is to become a proficient Software Tester therefore I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. 
On this site I would like to share my all gained experience in order to come closer to get a junior position in testing.

👍 No issues while rotating the phone, I was able to take and make calls as well as take the messages
